# SMS Gateway

The smsgateway is a Python3 based software solution to send SMS with HTTPs REST calls (web interface) using commodity hardware. 

It's scalable in number of modems, routes SMS by targetnumber and runs on a single host as well as in a geographically distributed environment. For more information, documentation and help see the [smsgateway wiki](https://github.com/n0r1sk/smsgateway/wiki)!
